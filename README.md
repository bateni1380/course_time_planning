# course_time_planning
In this project I solved a problem of course planning given that which courses shouldn't be held at the same time and we want to maximize some ideal parameter in the plan.

I had written this code for one of my projects in combinational optimization course presented by Dr. Hooshmand On December 10, 2021 in Amirkabir University of technology.
